# CHRIS FELLI, 2019
# Design an LRU Cache
# It should support the following operations: get and put.
# - get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key 
#   if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
# - put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not 
#   already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should
#   invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

class LRUCache:
    
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        return None


# Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = LRUCache(capacity)
# param_1 = obj.get(key)
# obj.put(key,value)
